    "original = '''The rumors are true! The time has arrived. Codeup has officially opened applications to our new Data Science career accelerator, with only 25 seats available! This immersive program is one of a kind in San Antonio, and will help you land a job in Glassdoor’s #1 Best Job in America. Data Science is a method of providing actionable intelligence from data. The data revolution has hit San Antonio, resulting in an explosion in Data Scientist positions across companies like USAA, Accenture, Booz Allen Hamilton, and HEB. We’ve even seen UTSA invest $70 M for a Cybersecurity Center and School of Data Science. We built a program to specifically meet the growing demands of this industry. Our program will be 18 weeks long, full-time, hands-on, and project-based. Our curriculum development and instruction is led by Senior Data Scientist, Maggie Giust, who has worked at HEB, Capital Group, and Rackspace, along with input from dozens of practitioners and hiring partners. Students will work with real data sets, realistic problems, and the entire data science pipeline from collection to deployment. They will receive professional development training in resume writing, interviewing, and continuing education to prepare for a smooth transition to the workforce. We focus on applied data science for immediate impact and ROI in a business, which is how we can back it all up with a 6 month tuition refund guarantee – just like our existing Web Dev program. We’re focusing on Data Science with Python, SQL, and ML, covered in 14 modules: 1) Fundamentals; 2) Applied statistics; 3) SQL; 4) Python; 5) Supervised machine learning – regression; 6) Supervised machine learning – classification; 7) Unsupervised machine learning – clustering; 8) Time series analysis; 9) Anomaly detection; 10) Natural language processing; 11) Distributed machine learning; 12) Advanced topics (deep learning, NoSQL, cloud deployment, etc.); 13) Storytelling with data; and 14) Domain expertise development. Applications are now open for Codeup’s first Data Science cohort, which will start class on February 4, 2019. Hurry – there are only 25 seats available! To further our mission of cultivating inclusive growth, scholarships will be available to women, minorities, LGBTQIA+ individuals, veterans, first responders, and people relocating to San Antonio. If you want to learn about joining our program or hiring our graduates, email datascience@codeup.com!'''\n"

       "'By Dimitri AntoniouA week ago, Codeup launched our immersive Data Science career accelerator! With our first class kicking off in February and only 25 seats available, we’ve been answering a lot of questions from prospective students. One in particular has come up so many times we decided to dedicate a blog post to it. What is the difference between data science and data analytics?First, let’s define some of our terms! Take a look at this blog to understand what Data Science is. In short, it is a method of turning raw data into action, leading to a desired outcome. Big Data refers to data sets that are large and complex, usually exceeding the capacity of computers and normal processing power to deal with. Machine Learning is the process of ‘learning’ underlying patterns of data in order to automate the extraction of intelligence from that data.Now, let’s look at the data pipeline that data scientists work through to reach the actionable insights and outcomes we mentioned:We start by collecting data, which may come from social media channels, network logs, financials, employee records, or more.We then process that data into usable information stored in databases or streamed.Next, we look back on the history of that data to summarize, describe, and explain, turning the data into meaningful knowledge. Here we’re primarily using mathematics, statistics, and visualization methods.Now we convert that knowledge into intelligence, seeking to predict future events so that we can make decisions in the present. This is where practitioners will introduce mathematical/statistical modeling through machine learning to their data.Finally, we enable action by building automations, running tests, building visualizations, monitoring new data, etc.Data professionals work at different stages of the spectrum to move data through the pipeline. On the left, Big Data Engineers specialize in collecting, storing, and processing data, getting it from Data to Information. In the middle, analysts work to understand and convert that information to knowledge. Lastly, a Machine Learning Engineer utilizes machine learning algorithms to turn intelligence into action by building automations, visualizations, recommendations, and predictions.Data Scientists span multiple stages of this pipeline, from information to action. They will spend about 70% of their time wrangling data in the information stage. They will conduct statistical analysis to derive knowledge. Lastly, they predict future events and build automations using machine learning.For those technical folk out there, data science is to data engineering or machine learning engineering as full-stack development is to front-end or back-end development. For the non-technical folk, data science is the umbrella term that houses data analytics, machine learning, and other data professions.So what’s the biggest difference between a data analyst and a data scientist? Data scientists utilize computer programming and machine learning in addition to mathematics and statistics. Still have questions? Reach out to us at (210) 802-7289 or DataScience@codeup.com!
